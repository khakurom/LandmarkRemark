# Technology stack
- Android (Kotlin)
- XML
- Coroutine 
- Flow
- Real-time database of Firebase service
# Approach to the solution
- A user is able to register an account with the app
- A user is able to login/logout
- A user can view their location on the map
- A user can view all landmarks that are created by their own as well as other users
- A user is able to add a new landmark at their location on the map
- A user can view the landmark list, including landmark names, user name, latitude and longitude values in every single landmark
- A user can search landmarks based on the name of a landmark or user name in the list
# Time estimate
- Feature login account: 1h
- Feature register account: 1h
- Feature map view: 4h
- Feature display landmark list: 2h
- Total: 8h
# Issue of the solution
- When many landmarks are created at the same location, the labels displayed overlap each other. It requires the user to zoom in close to view landmarks clearly
